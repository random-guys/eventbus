Event Bus (should have named it _Danfo_ tbh) is a wrapper around the Node.js RabbitMQ library [amqp.node](https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node)

## To Use

`yarn add @randomguys/eventbus`
or
`npm install @randomguys/eventbus`

## Integration test

`docker-compose up`

## TODO

- Improve tests
- Write docs
- Make library more extensible?
